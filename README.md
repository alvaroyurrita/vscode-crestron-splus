This is a language package for programming Crestron SIMPL+ module. It has syntax highlighting, document formatting,
snippets for a lot of S+ functions and code blocks, build tasks to compile your code, and a shortcut for the S+ help file.
After installing the extension, please open your VSCode Settings (CTRL-Comma) and search for Splus and verify/update the
file locations in there.

## Use CTRL+SHIFT+B to compile your S+ code
# You must enable or disable the platforms you wish to compile for in the settings. By default only 3 series is enabled.

This extension currently requires that VSCode has opened the containing folder the S+ file(s) are in. As of 0.4.2, the extension will open the folder for you when open a single file, but only if VSCode doesn't have another folder open. If you are getting `No build errors found` messages when building S+ files, make sure you have the opened the containing folder.
